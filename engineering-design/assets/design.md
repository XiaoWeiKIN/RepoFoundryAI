# {{TITLE}}

This document is the entrypoint for `{{DESIGN_ID}}`. The logical Design and all
managed package members share one review and approval boundary.

## Design Summary

<!-- REQUIRED: State the selected system shape, user-visible outcome, and validity conditions. -->

## Goals and Non-goals

<!-- REQUIRED: State owned outcomes and explicit exclusions. -->

## Research and Decision Inputs

<!-- REQUIRED: Summarize the evidence, accepted ADR constraints, remaining unknowns, and validity conditions that materially shape this architecture. Do not provide only links. -->

## System Context and Invariants

<!-- REQUIRED: Define existing boundaries and invariants. Use Mermaid when relationships matter. -->

## Proposed Architecture

<!-- REQUIRED: Explain the system shape, core abstractions, responsibility boundaries, ownership, dependency direction, and extension points. Link focused package members where deeper treatment helps the reader. -->

## Control and Data Flows

<!-- REQUIRED: Trace one to three representative requests, data items, state transitions, or resource lifecycles end to end. Include failure or concurrency behavior only where it shapes the architecture. -->

## Alternatives, Open Questions, and Revisit Triggers

<!-- REQUIRED: Record meaningful rejected shapes, unresolved architecture questions, owners where known, and evidence that would change this design. -->
